For example a student needs to study 5 subjects and have important family fucntion coming up then this ML algorithm can take in inputs of the task prioritize them and generate an effective time tables to achive goals. Also this will help save time in bigger firms which takes a lot of time to create a timeline for management of projects and functions.\n",
