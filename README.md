# AI-Time-Manager
a time management app which will arrange the series of events and manage event according to the priority of the event. For example a student needs to study 5 subjects and have important family fucntion coming up then this ML algorithm can take in inputs of the task prioritize them and generate an effective time tables to achive goals. Also this will help save time in bigger firms which takes a lot of time to create a timeline for management of projects and functions.

We will be using various ml algorithms to gain the results:

1. Enabled speech recognition using API tokens as an additional option to get data.
2. Using NLP to extract important keywords and task from the given data
3. Priority assignment using ml algorithm using clustering
4. Generating a time table using a deep learnign model.
